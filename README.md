# Congress-Lookup-Website-And-App
Website and iOS App which provide detailed lookup of people and work of Congress

# Notes
Due to the closure of Sunlight Labs, [Sunlight foundation](https://sunlightfoundation.com/api/) no longer provides API service, which is taken over to other organizations. And because of I haven't been maintaining the web and app since January 2017, the information is not shown up now in the web and app.

Since January 2017, the website is simply serviced by University of Southern California host service, which is free instead of using AWS.
